# Odyssey Hackathon 2020 – Standards

## What is a standard?

Standards are agreements between multiple parties. Standards are developed by groups of experts. These experts work together in committees, which are organized by subject. Each committee manages multiple standards. Please find more information about standardization on [nen.nl](https://www.nen.nl/Over-NEN.htm).

Standards are developed at 3 levels:

1. In The Netherlands at NEN
2. In Europe by CEN and CENELEC
3. Globally by ISO and IEC

In this overview, information on standardization is organized by subject. Most standards are available in the English language. However, local information on Dutch standardization is only available in Dutch.

## How can my Odyssey team access standards?

Odyssey teams can access standards through [NEN Connect](https://connect.nen.nl/Home/Detail). Odyssey participants can sign up to NEN Connect via [odyssey@nen.nl](mailto:odyssey@nen.nl).

## Which standards are relevant to my Odyssey challenge?

For each subject an immense number of standards exist. Therefore we provide you with starting points for your search for relevant standards.
